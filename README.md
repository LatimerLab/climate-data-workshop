# climate-data-workshop
Contains code for lab meeting workshop in F2024 on accessing climate data 

It includes scripts for manual data wrangling -- useful no matter what you're doing -- plus more specific scripts for accessing PRISM and GridMET data.

We didn't include the data in this repo because it takes up too much space. The prism_library_example script contains commands to download the data so you could do it yourself if you like. Data for this workshop are also available in a box folder: https://ucdavis.box.com/s/j467di1rh2ww9qkmi5ynj1w0x63trlge 
 
If you add this shared Box folder to the filesystem of your Mac laptop, you'll probably find the folder at "/Users/[yourusername]/Library/CloudStorage/Box-Box/ClimateDataWorkshop".

This folder has folders containing some monthly and annual prism data, plus some daily gridmet data, and some example location info (PLSS and seed zones, plus Derek's GPS points).
