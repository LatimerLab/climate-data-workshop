# climate-data-workshop
Contains code for lab meeting workshop in F2024 on accessing climate data 

We didn't include the data in this repo because it takes up too much space. The prism_library_example script contains commands to download the data so you could do it yourself if you like. Data for this workshop are also available in a box folder: https://ucdavis.box.com/s/j467di1rh2ww9qkmi5ynj1w0x63trlge
